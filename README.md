This project is a MazeRunner game that uses BufferedReader to read in files that contain mazes, codes file into Arrays, uses positional methods (Keep track of where in the Array the cursor is),
updates Arrays and prints to screen each Array iteration and special screen when maze is complete. Just a project to experiment with changing/printing Arrays to console output.
